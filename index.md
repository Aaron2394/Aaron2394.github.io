I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

Lab 6 Part 1:
I enjoyed lab 6 part 1 as in this, we used words from the command line and used them to fill in the blanks. This was also one of the first labs that was challenging for me and took some time experimenting to get it right. The learning objective for this lab was to take command line arguments from the user and place them into a vector, then use those values to fill in the blanks of a sentence. This lab taught us how to use vectors, user input from the command land, and manipulating those values.

Lab 7 Part 1
I enjoyed lab 7 part 1 because this was a unique lab. I enjoyed looking at signs for the hours you can and canâ€™t part and it felt like what we were coding actually was connecting to something in real life. The learning objects of this lab was to learn how to use functions, and to identify requirements each function had based on the signs using statements. The lab also continued our practice of user arguments.

Lab 8 Part 2
I enjoyed this lab as in this one, we tried to create a pattern using loops. This lab was enjoyable because I had fun seeing the pattern as I coded and experimented on it. It was nice seeing the wrong versions and right versions of the code and how the pattern would change based on small changes I made. The primary learning objective for lab 8 part 2 was to use a nested for loop to create a pattern. Our for loops and to have the right amount of iterations for this to work.
